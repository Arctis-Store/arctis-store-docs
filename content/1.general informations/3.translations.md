# Translations

### Location and setting

> You will find all translations in the catalogue `<resource>/locales`.

> To select the current translation, go to `config.lua` of the given resource, and edit `Config.Language` by entering the file name without extension with the translation inside.

### Create own translate

> - Go to directory `<resource>/locales` .
> - Copy any file and paste.
> - Rename it to the language you want to add.
> - Enter the file and at the very top also change the name to the same name you gave to the directory.
> - Start your translation by **editing only the values on the right**.
