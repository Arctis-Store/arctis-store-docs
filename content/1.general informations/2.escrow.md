# Asset Escrow

The Assets FiveM Escrow system is a tool developed in cooperation between Tebex and FiveM, which allows you to hide the full asset code and remotely load it onto servers. This system safely protects Arctis Store resources against any free leaks.


### Error parsing script / Failed to load script

> Your server artifacts are likely outdated. Update your server to version **5181** or above.


### You lack the required entitlement to use `arctis_<resource>`

> Try restarting your server and make sure your server key is correct. If you bought the resource on the wrong account, you can transfer it to another account on keymaster.


### Failed to verify protected resource

> Files were possibly corrupted during transfer. Ensure hidden files are copied; the .fxap file in a protected resource must be included. Some FTP programs skip these files. **Try using e.g.** [Winscp](https://winscp.net/eng/download.php).
