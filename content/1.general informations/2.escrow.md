# Asset Escrow

The Asset Escrow system, developed in partnership with Tebex 2.9k, provides a reasonable alternative to obfuscation and IP locking. By ensuring purchase ownership, your content will, and can only run on the servers of your customers, nowhere else. On top of that, your resources will be encrypted to prevent your work from being leaked.


### Error parsing script / Failed to load script

> Your server artifacts are likely outdated. Update your server to version 5181 or above.


### You lack the required entitlement to use `arctis_<resource>`

> Try restarting your server and make sure your server key is correct. If you bought the resource on the wrong account, you can transfer it to another account on keymaster.


### Failed to verify protected resource

> Files were possibly corrupted during transfer. Ensure hidden files are copied; the .fxap file in a protected resource must be included. Some FTP programs skip these files.
